üí° Code Breakdown & Explanation
1Ô∏è‚É£ Authentication System
The app requires users to log in with a username and password stored in the .env file.
If the login fails, access is denied.
python
Copy
Edit
USERNAME = os.getenv("USERNAME")
PASSWORD = os.getenv("PASSWORD")

st.sidebar.header("Login")
username = st.sidebar.text_input("Username")
password = st.sidebar.text_input("Password", type="password")

if st.sidebar.button("Login"):
    if username == USERNAME and password == PASSWORD:
        st.session_state["logged_in"] = True
        st.sidebar.success("Login Successful!")
    else:
        st.sidebar.error("Invalid username or password")
2Ô∏è‚É£ Database Setup & Management (SQLite)
The system uses SQLite as a lightweight database.
The database has two main tables:
books ‚Üí Stores all books.
checked_out_books ‚Üí Stores books that are currently checked out.
python
Copy
Edit
def create_database():
    conn = sqlite3.connect("library.db")
    c = conn.cursor()
    
    # Books Table
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS books 
                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY AUTOINCREMENT, title TEXT, author TEXT, genre TEXT, year INTEGER)''')

    # Checked Out Books Table
    c.execute('''CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS checked_out_books 
                 (id INTEGER PRIMARY KEY, title TEXT, author TEXT, genre TEXT, year INTEGER, return_date TEXT)''')

    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
3Ô∏è‚É£ Adding a Book
Users can add books through a Streamlit sidebar form.
The book is stored in the books table.
python
Copy
Edit
def add_book(title, author, genre, year):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("library.db")
    c = conn.cursor()
    c.execute("INSERT INTO books (title, author, genre, year) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?)", 
              (title, author, genre, year))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
4Ô∏è‚É£ Searching for Books
Users can search for books by title, author, or genre.
The search function uses SQL wildcard matching (LIKE query).
python
Copy
Edit
def search_books(search_query):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("library.db")
    c = conn.cursor()
    search_term = f"%{search_query}%"
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM books WHERE title LIKE ? OR author LIKE ? OR genre LIKE ?", 
              (search_term, search_term, search_term))
    books = c.fetchall()
    conn.close()
    return books
5Ô∏è‚É£ Checking Out & Checking In Books
üîπ Check Out
The check-out function:
Moves the book to checked_out_books.
Assigns a 14-day return deadline.
python
Copy
Edit
def check_out_book(book_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("library.db")
    c = conn.cursor()

    c.execute("SELECT * FROM books WHERE id=?", (book_id,))
    book = c.fetchone()

    if book:
        title, author, genre, year = book[1], book[2], book[3], book[4]
        return_date = (datetime.now() + timedelta(days=14)).strftime("%Y-%m-%d")

        c.execute("INSERT INTO checked_out_books (id, title, author, genre, year, return_date) VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?, ?)",
                  (book_id, title, author, genre, year, return_date))
        conn.commit()

    conn.close()
    st.session_state["refresh"] = True
üîπ Check In
Removes the book from checked_out_books, making it available again.
python
Copy
Edit
def check_in_book(book_id):
    conn = sqlite3.connect("library.db")
    c = conn.cursor()
    
    c.execute("DELETE FROM checked_out_books WHERE id=?", (book_id,))
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
    st.session_state["refresh"] = True
6Ô∏è‚É£ Auto-Return Books After 14 Days
If a checked-out book isn't returned in 14 days, it automatically becomes available again.
python
Copy
Edit
def auto_return_books():
    conn = sqlite3.connect("library.db")
    c = conn.cursor()
    
    current_date = datetime.now().strftime("%Y-%m-%d")
    c.execute("SELECT * FROM checked_out_books WHERE return_date < ?", (current_date,))
    overdue_books = c.fetchall()

    for book in overdue_books:
        book_id, title, author, genre, year, _ = book
        c.execute("DELETE FROM checked_out_books WHERE id=?", (book_id,))
    
    conn.commit()
    conn.close()
7Ô∏è‚É£ AI Chatbot for Book Descriptions
Uses OpenAI's GPT-4 API to retrieve book details.
python
Copy
Edit
def get_book_description(title):
    response = client.chat.completions.create(
        model="gpt-4",
        messages=[{"role": "system", "content": "You are a library assistant."},
                  {"role": "user", "content": f"Tell me about the book '{title}'"}]
    )
    return response.choices[0].message.content
üîç RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Attempt
I attempted to implement a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) model to enhance the search engine.
However, due to time constraints and performance issues, the implementation wasn't completed under pressure.

The current search engine relies on SQLite queries, which work well for now.
In the future, I plan to integrate vector-based search (FAISS or Pinecone) for more advanced AI-powered search capabilities.

üîÆ Future Improvements
Switch to MongoDB for better scalability.
Implement an AI-powered search engine using FAISS or Pinecone.
Improve UI/UX for a better user experience.
